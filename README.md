## Background

![Citi-Bikes](Images/citi-bike-station-bikes.jpg)

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Task

**Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.** 

**Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you may merge multiple datasets from different periods.** 

**Next, as a chronic over-achiever:**

* Use your visualizations (does not have to be all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomena.
* The dashboards should be accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring. 

**City officials would also like to see one of the following visualizations:**

* **Basic:** A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

* **Advanced:** A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.

* The map you choose should also be accompanied by a write-up unveiling any trends that were noticed during your analysis.

## Citi Bike Analysis

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. The following dashboard was designed to analyze Citi Bike data by station and customer. 

Each tab of the dashboard features information from 2018 Citi Bike. Both tabs include filters at the top to filter the data. After creating and analyzing our visualizations, there were many phenomena to be uncovered.

1.	“Grove ST PATH” and “Hamilton Park” are the most popular stations. Trips often start and end at these two stations. This may indicate a need of a third station to give more flexibility to customers

2.	The most popular start times for bike rental are correlated with commuter traffic. Bike rentals usage increases right until 9:00am and once again increases until 5:00pm, right before it begins decreasing. The number of bike rentals is also higher on weekdays than weekends. This shows majority of rentals are possibly used as primary source of transportation. I would propose Citi bike partner with companies around the area to promote usage through discounts and installing stations on company property. 

3.	Millennials and Generation X are the two biggest age generation of users by far. The age frame for these two generations is for anyone born between 1965 and 1996. Citibank could start rolling out subscriptions to target high schools. Thus, increasing usage and subscribers.
